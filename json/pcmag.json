    "content": "Former President Donald Trump offered to sell his social media platform Truth Social to Elon Musk last summer, The Washington Post reports. The conversation, which has been kept under wraps until now, didn't come to anything. At the time, Truth Social faced significant financial challenges. Trump founded Truth Social in February 2022, about a year after he was kicked off Twitter (now X) and Meta's apps following the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the Capitol. Truth Social functions the same way as X, though users share \"truths\" and \"retruths\" instead of \"tweets\" and \"retweets.\" By 2023, the platform had burned through cash and failed to attract sufficient ad revenue. It reported $31.6 million in losses between 2021 and mid-2023, according to Reuters. After Musk's Twitter takeover, he restored Trump's account, though Trump has only posted on X once since then, when his mug shot came out. Trump has been more active on Facebook since Meta restored his accounts there last year, mostly with campaign-related posts, but his unedited thoughts usually end up on Truth Social. Truth Social got the financial relief it needed last month, when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the long-delayed merger of Truth Social with Digital World Acquisition, The Washington Post reports. The deal sets the stage for Truth Social to become a publicly traded company and unlocks a much-needed $300 million in investor cash. Musk and Trump have continued to communicate, most recently meeting at Mar-a-Lago. Neither has publicly disclosed the nature of the conversation. After reports suggested Trump could be asking Musk, the world's second-richest man, for funds amid his most recent legal troubles, Musk posted on X that he is \u201cnot donating money to either candidate for US President.\u201d"

    "title": "TikTok's Chinese Version Douyin Is Viewable on US Web Browsers (for Now)",

    "content": "Ever wanted to take a peek at videos on Douyin, China's original version of TikTok? Now you can\u2014if you use a computer's web browser. A quick test of Douyin's website with a US IP address confirms that the site is viewable from the US. It displays videos in landscape orientation, unlike TikTok, which is locked into its signature portrait orientation on both web browsers and its mobile app. While Douyin prompts viewers to create an account, it's easy to avoid this and scroll through the main feed of content. Scanning the QR code on the page takes viewers to the app store, but it's not possible to install Douyin on a US iOS device. The Google Play Store's Douyin listing is viewable from US web browsers. Douyin's website also loads on a US iOS device, but it doesn't allow users to watch videos like the web version. Instead, it prompts users to install the app. Apple's App Store still has it blocked, though, and won't show the app's store page. Instead, it displays the standard message: \"This app is currently not available in your country or region.\" Like TikTok, Douyin's web version has a personalized feed and a \"following\" feed. It also has a main home tab, a profile tab, and tabs that appear to be for live streams, gaming, informational, music, food, and entertainment content. Compared to TikTok, that's a lot more categories for users to choose from. TikTok users can use its search function and hashtags to find desired content, however. Some US lawmakers who want TikTok banned have criticized it for allegedly offering dangerous content to US users, claiming that Douyin users get more educational content. Without logging in, a brief test showed Douyin videos that appeared to present movies about plane heists and anime videos with characters in prison. Clips of zoo animals, women's faces, and women dancing were also encountered on the main home feed. Some more adult-appropriate content appeared as well, like a video of two girls shoving each other in the street and another of a water gun that's designed to look like a submachine gun being used to wash a car. This quick test didn't provide educational videos, but it did offer a lot of cutdowns of preexisting media as well as a random assortment of real-life footage. It's unclear when exactly Douyin's website and videos became so freely visible on US web browsers. Writer and TikTok user Jules Terpak, who noticed the change and posted a video of a Douyin feed on Twitter, notes that the site wasn't this accessible before. \"Not sure when they did this (I last checked this time last year) but they likely did so to create a sense of transparency,\" Terpak writes. But Douyin's visibility to US web users may be short-lived. The US House of Representatives are set to vote on a nationwide bill Wednesday that would impact TikTok, and President Biden has already said he would support its passage. While many Republicans support the bill, both Donald Trump and Elon Musk have criticized it for different reasons. The bill, dubbed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, would ban TikTok and any foreign adversary-owned application from being accessed on US web browsers or mobile apps unless TikTok severs its ties to China. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson has reportedly criticized the bill. But as Reuters reports, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines believes there is a chance that China's Communist Party could use TikTok to influence US federal elections set to take place later this year. \"We cannot rule out that the CCP would use it,\" Haines said on the matter. This week, TikTok CEO Sou Chew has been lobbying against the bill in Washington, D.C. The social media firm plans to take legal action to the best of its ability before considering a ByteDance separation, Bloomberg reports."

    "date": "March 12, 2024",
    "content": "Apple is going to let users download iOS apps from developer websites and bypass app stores entirely, but only in the European Union.\u00a0The only catch is that app makers must agree to Apple's strict rules for distribution, which can include paying the company a commission. In the EU, the iPhone maker plans on launching the \u201cweb distribution\u201d option later this spring through a software update. \u201cApple will provide authorized developers access to APIs that facilitate the distribution of their apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users\u2019 apps, and more,\u201d the company said in Tuesday\u2019s announcement. Apple is doing so to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is requiring the major tech giants to open up their platforms to greater competition. In Apple\u2019s case, this has included allowing interested companies to create their own third-party iOS app stores for the EU. In addition to third-party app stores, the company is going to let \u201cauthorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website the developer owns and operates,\u201d Apple said in a support document. However, the company is implementing strict rules on the web distribution to prevent it from fueling malware and scams. \u201cTo install apps from a developer\u2019s website, users will first need to approve the developer to install apps in Settings on their iPhone,\u201d Apple notes. \u201cWhen installing an app, a system sheet will display information that developers have submitted to Apple for review, like the app name, developer name, app description, screenshots, and system age rating.\u201d Developers interested in distributing iOS apps on their websites also have to cross a high bar. This includes being registered or incorporated in the EU, being a member of \u201cgood standing in the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more,\u201d and having an app that received \u201cmore than one million first annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.\u201d Apple will also vet the apps, which must receive official \u201cnotarization\u201d from the company, before they can distributed on third-party platforms. Hence, it looks like Apple is going to restrict the web distribution to major software companies. To distribute an iOS app outside Apple\u2019s App Store, developers also need to agree to the company\u2019s new payment model, which bucks the standard 30% commission. Instead, developers must pay a 17% or 10% commission, and fork over \u201c\u20ac0.50 for each first annual install\u201d if their app crosses one million total installs over a 12-month period. Only nonprofit groups, educational organizations, and government agencies are exempt from the fee. Critics have since slammed the new fee structure, calling it anticompetitive. \"This is extortion, plain and simple,\" Spotify said in January. \"For any developer wondering if this might work for you, you need to have less than a million customers and essentially sign up for not growing in the long run.\""

    "title": "Google Restricts Gemini AI From Answering Election-Related Questions",

    "date": "March 12, 2024",
    "content": "To stop the spread of misinformation, Google is restricting its Gemini chatbot from answering any election-related questions. The tech giant mentioned the restriction in a blog post about supporting the elections in India. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution on such an important topic, we have begun to roll out restrictions on the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe take our responsibility for providing high-quality information for these types of queries seriously, and are continuously working to improve our protections.\u201d But it looks like the restrictions go beyond India. If you ask Gemini about elections occurring in the US or other countries, the chatbot will deflect and simply say: \u201cI'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search.\u201d Google also indicated to PCMag that the restriction is rolling out widely, saying \"in preparation for the many elections happening around the world in 2024 and out of an abundance of caution, we\u2019re restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses.\" The news arrives weeks after Gemini found itself embroiled in another controversy over generating historically inaccurate images of people, which some found offensive. For example, if you asked it to generate images of America\u2019s \u201cFounding Fathers,\u201d Gemini could return pictures depicting a black, Native American, or Asian person instead. In response, Google has temporarily disabled Gemini\u2019s ability to create images of people until the issue is ironed out. Muzzling Gemini's ability to answer election-related topics could help Google avoid more embarrassment. But it\u2019s also not a strong sign for Gemini, which the company envisions augmenting and possibly replacing traditional Google Search results."

    "title": "Dyson's Latest Robot Vacuum Launches in the US on March 19, And It's Not Cheap",
    "author": "Andrew Gebhart",
    "author_link": "https://www.pcmag.com/authors/andrew-gebhart",
    "date": "March 12, 2024",
    "content": "Dyson\u2019s highly anticipated robot vacuum, the 360 Vis Nav, has an official US release date: The high-powered, automatic cleaner is slated to go on sale March 19 for $1,199. It features 65 air watts of suction power, which Dyson claims is two times the power of any competitor. It also offers whole-machine HEPA filtration, a panoramic 360 camera, a Hyperdymium motor that spins at 135,000rpm, a side air duct for edge and corner cleaning, and a Piezo sensor to detect dirt as it works. The company is known for its powerful and expensive cordless and upright vacuums, so this latest robot model holds a lot of promise. The 360 Vis Nav will be the first robot vacuum that Dyson has released in the US in over half a decade. The last one it launched, the Dyson 360 Eye, was in 2016. A follow-up, the 360 Heurist, debuted in 2020 but never came to the US. The 360 Vis Nav first launched in Australia in early 2023, so most details about the robot itself are known, but Dyson has issued a few software updates since then, and an upcoming rollout will allow it to use the dirt data collected with its piezo sensor to rank rooms in terms of dirt level and prioritize cleaning accordingly. The 360 Vis Nav isn\u2019t a hybrid robot mop and vacuum. It doesn\u2019t even have a self-emptying base station. As far as hardware features, Dyson elected to keep the Vis Nav focused on cleaning capability. Dyson will use the 360 camera to navigate your home while avoiding obstacles, but promises captured images never leave the robot. It uses distance sensors and optical flow sensors to create a map as it works. It will use this navigation tech to prioritize the middle of the room first. Its brushroll combines different materials from the swappable vacuum heads on its popular stick vacuum lines: a soft \u201cfluffy\u201d nylon grabs debris from hard floors, anti-static carbon fiber filaments collect dust, and stiff nylon bristles dig into carpet. After sweeping the middle, the vacuum will turn to the edges with a side air duct instead of the usual spinning side brush. The air duct reaches walls and corners and extends the vacuum\u2019s suction instead of sweeping dirt toward a central brush roll. The robot uses the piezo sensor to gauge what it\u2019s picking up as it works and create a kind of \u201cheat map\u201d of dirt on the Dyson app, the company says. The 360 Vis Nav will have four cleaning modes: auto, quiet, boost, and quick which prioritizes the middle of the floors instead of edges to get the job done rapidly. The dust bin has a large 0.5-liter capacity and emptying it looks similar to the process for its cordless vacuums. An eject button drives dirt out and into your trash. Given the large dustbin, you shouldn\u2019t have to empty it after every run. Dyson wanted a minimal base station that doesn't require you to buy replacement dust bags, so the company avoided a self-emptying feature. With self-emptying now a fairly common feature for robot vacuums these days, I\u2019ll be curious just how inconvenient it feels to have to go back to emptying the dust bin manually on a premium vacuum. While most competitors list their robots' suction power in Pascals (Pa), Dyson is using the less common metric of air watts. A Dyson rep claimed that air watts are a better measure of actual suction instead of just pressure, but it also makes it harder to compare Dyson\u2019s suction at face value. We plan to put the Dyson 360 Vis Nav through our extensive pickup performance tests as soon as possible to find out just how well this high-power suction works in the real-world. As is typical for the brand, the 360 Vis Nav is expensive. For comparison, the iRobot Roomba j9+ is a premium robot vacuum without mopping capabilities but with a self-emptying base station, and it costs $899.99. Stay tuned for our full Dyson 360 Vis Nav review and check out our other favorite robot vacuums in the meantime."

    "content": "By changing the name of its AI chatbot from Bard to Gemini, Google spurred new interest and brought more traffic to the system than ever before. Google made the change on Feb. 8, and traffic immediately began climbing, according to new data from web analytics company Similarweb. It peaked on Feb. 22, the same day controversy over its image generator swirled, at 17.5 million visits. Traffic has come back down to 13.2 million daily visits as of March 3, but still above the daily average for Bard. (Note: The remaining visits to bard.google.com in the graph below \"represent people going to that address before being redirected\" to gemini.google.com.) However, Gemini is still only the third most-popular AI chatbot, and its traffic lags far behind ChatGPT. ChatGPT's traffic has also clearly surpassed search engine Microsoft Bing, after first matching its traffic in March 2023. In the US, ChatGPT usage reached a new traffic high in Feb. 2024, with 208.8 million visits. That's up 87% year-over-year and 15% month-over-month. Globally, ChatGPT's traffic has not quite returned to its May 2023 peak of 1.8 billion visits, achieving 1.6 billion visits in Feb. 2024. ChatGPT has also found success with its new GPTs. Billed as \"personalized agents\" for a wide range of tasks, including logo generation, translation services, and even romantic love, GPTs are only available to those with a ChatGPT Plus subscription ($20 per month). Up-and-coming AI tools such as Claude, Perplexity, and Character.AI have a long way to go before catching ChatGPT. Microsoft's AI-powered Copilot raked in the least traffic of any system included in the study. Just one component of the wider Bing ecosystem, Copilot serves \"as a distinct destination for accessing AI functionality,\" Similarweb says. \"[It's] one piece of a much broader Microsoft strategy to incorporate CoPilot-branded AI features into Office, as well as tools for developers and designers.\""

    "date": "March 12, 2024",
    "content": "The Midjourney 6 AI image generator, which is currently in alpha and operates through Discord, has released a new \"character reference\" feature that allows users to effectively use a single character across different images, the Midjourney team shared on Monday night. This means users can add one or more web URL links or upload character images and the AI can incorporate that character along with the rest of a prompt to generate custom content based on that character reference. But Midjourney says the new feature, also known as \"cref,\" is best for characters created by the AI itself. This new feature is similar to Midjourney's existing \"style reference\" feature. \"It's not designed for real people/photos,\" a Midjourney Discord admin wrote in the announcement post, adding that doing so \"will likely distort them as regular image prompts do.\" That hasn't stopped Midjourney users from trying, though. One YouTuber already managed to get Midjourney to take a reference image of soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo and generate multiple different images of him. The results definitely resemble Ronaldo, albeit to varying extents, even depicting him as a character from a dystopian cyberpunk world. While the new feature is still being tested, according to the AI firm, it's already generated some consistent results. The \"strength\" of the character match can be tuned so that the character's outfit remains consistent or changes with every image generated. But using others' online images to generate new ones poses some ethical concerns. For one, Midjourney's new character reference tool could make it even easier for bad actors to make convincing deepfakes. Pulling character references from artists' work could also pose copyright concerns if users then attempt to commercialize or otherwise publish their Midjourney creations. Generative AI tools have already sparked a number of copyright lawsuits, from The New York Times fighting OpenAI and Microsoft to a group of book authors suing Nvidia. Such litigation also raises questions around whether or to what extent generative AI tools and their creations violate existing copyright laws by pulling from artists' protected work without their consent. Visual artists have also expressed their concerns when it comes to Midjourney specifically, calling it \"dehumanizing\" and criticizing it for using artists' work for profit without compensation. Midjourney previously offered a free trial, but removed the option last year due to \"abuse\" and high demand. Last week, Midjourney also reportedly went on a Twitter blocking spree and alleged that rival Stability AI employees deployed \"botnet-like activity\" onto its platform. Midjourney's Monday announcement states that its V6 beta is \"coming soon.\""

    "content": "Tax season is upon us, and if you live in one of 12 states, you can bypass traditional tax software and use the IRS' new direct-file system. The first iteration of Direct File is fairly barebones, and currently locked to 12 states: Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming, Arizona, Massachusetts, California, and New York. There are also a number of eligibility hurdles to clear. It only applies to standard deductions instead of itemized ones, for example, and doesn't work with most types of Form 1099s or if you used the Healthcare.gov marketplace to purchase a health insurance plan. In short, if you have a W-2, are taking the standard deduction, and you made less than $125,000, the tax software should work for you. You'll need your Social Security number and a valid form of ID to check it out. Everybody else will have to default to available tax prep services like H&R Block, TurboTax, or Credit Karma. According to the AP, the Treasury Department estimates that 19 million people can make use of Direct File this tax season. The ultimate goal is to save people money on tax prep. \"Direct File will offer millions of Americans a free and simple way to file their taxes, with no expensive and unnecessary filing fees and no upselling, putting hundreds of dollars back in the pocket of working families each year, consistent with President Biden's pledge to lower costs,\" National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement. The IRS didn't get here easily. It filed a report to Congress last year that said it could need anywhere from $64.3 million to $248.9 million per year, dependent on how many taxpayers the system will support and the complexity of the supported tax situations it ends up handling. Intuit and other tax prep services aren't going down without a fight either. Intuit last year argued that the Direct File system is \"wholly redundant\" and a \"solution looking for a problem.\""

    "date": "March 13, 2024",
    "content": "Music streaming platform Spotify is finally adding music videos to its desktop, mobile, and TV app versions\u2014but only for a few artists and paying Premium users in select regions. When a song is playing, a button will appear that reads \"switch to video,\" allowing users to toggle the music video mode on for viewing. When they're done watching, they can press the same button, which reads \"switch to audio.\" On iOS and Android mobile devices, music videos are able to play in vertical or landscape mode. While Spotify's announcement suggests the company will eventually bring the feature to more countries, it's only available for Premium subscribers in the UK, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Brazil, Colombia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Kenya for now as part of its limited public beta. Spotify is also only adding music videos for a few artists to start, noting that Ed Sheeran, Doja Cat, Aluna, Asake, and Ice Spice get the new feature for some of their songs. Spotify VP and Head of Music and Product Charlie Hellman said in a statement that music videos are important because they can become what \"hooks\" listeners and turns them into fans. \"They\u2019re an important part of so many artists\u2019 tool kits, and it\u2019s a natural fit for them to live in the same place that more than half a billion people choose to listen to music,\" Hellman said. For years, Spotify has offered its Canvas feature, which are brief video art pieces musicians can upload that play on loop when listening to a song. But these clipped video loops don't sync up with the audio being played, are only three to eight seconds long, and can only be viewed in vertical orientation on mobile. So while a good Canvas can add a couple seconds of visual intrigue, it's nothing compared to a fully fledged music video. Music videos rolling out on Spotify take it a step toward becoming a one-stop shop for songs, videos, events, artists bios, and merch. The new feature may help it keep a competitive edge with Apple Music and YouTube Music, as music videos may get Spotify subscribers to spend even more time on its music streaming app."

    "content": "To protect user privacy, Airbnb is banning hosts from placing indoor cameras at their properties. The use of surveillance cameras at Airbnbs has been a contentious issue: On the one hand, the cameras can help hosts protect their property. On the other hand, the cameras have been creeping users out for years. Previously, Airbnb only permitted hosts to place the indoor cameras in common areas, such as hallways or the living room. The cameras also had to be clearly disclosed on the listing page and the devices needed to be clearly visible. But the company has since decided to forbid indoor cameras entirely in an effort to prioritize user privacy and to simplify its policies. \u201cOur goal was to create new, clear rules that provide our community with greater clarity about what to expect on Airbnb,\u201d says Airbnb's head of Community Policy and Partnerships, Juniper Downs. \u201cThese changes were made in consultation with our guests, hosts and privacy experts, and we\u2019ll continue to seek feedback to help ensure our policies work for our global community.\u201d The only exception is for hotel listings on Airbnb; they can continue to use cameras to monitor indoor common areas. On outdoor cameras, Airbnb is also taking a stronger privacy stance. \u201cHosts will be required to disclose the presence and general location of any outdoor cameras before guests book,\u201d the company says. \u201cThese cameras will also be prohibited from monitoring indoor spaces of a listing and are not allowed in certain outdoor areas where there\u2019s a greater expectation of privacy, like an enclosed outdoor shower or sauna.\u201d The changes may annoy Airbnb hosts. But the company says \u201cthe majority of listings on Airbnb do not report having a security camera.\u201d In total, Airbnb has over 5 million hosts overseeing 7.7 million properties worldwide. The ban on indoor cameras will take effect on April 30. \u201cAfter this, reported violations of this policy brought to our attention will be investigated, and action we take can include listing or account removal,\u201d the company adds."

    "date": "March 12, 2024",
    "content": "A Microsoft scientist has concocted a way for OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model to play Doom, a game at which the AI apparently does not excel. Adrian de Wynter published a paper and a blog post documenting his attempts to see if GPT-4 could play the classic PC game. To do so, he tapped GPT-4 with Vision API, which lets the AI model receive visual images and create a corresponding action. He then crafted a program to take screenshots from a computer running Doom. The screenshots were fed to GPT-4, with the goal of having it beat the game. The answers were then converted into outputs used to control the game. For his experiment, de Wynter gave GPT-4 access to a system of prompt generators, which had received a walkthrough on how to win the game, and could account for past actions taken. The results found that OpenAI\u2019s technology can play Doom to a \u201cpassable\u201d degree, meaning the AI is smart enough to traverse the map and shoot at enemies. But when compared to the performance of a human, GPT-4 \u201ckinda fails at the game and my grandma has played it wayyy better than this model,\u201d de Wynter wrote in his blog post. For example, the AI model would \u201csometimes do really dumb things like getting stuck in corners and just punching the wall like an angsty teenager, or shooting point blank explosive barrels,\u201d he said. In addition, GPT-4 would often ignore enemies and act as if they didn\u2019t exist as soon as they dropped out of its field of view. \u201cMost of the time the model died because it got stuck in a corner and ended up being shot in the back,\u201d de Wynter added. The results suggest\u00a0 GPT-4 can struggle when it comes to long-term reasoning and \u201cobject permanence,\u201d or the ability to recognize that an object still exists, even though it can\u2019t be seen. The other problem is that OpenAI\u2019s model sometimes made up, or hallucinated, why it needed to take certain actions while playing the game. To be fair, GPT-4 wasn\u2019t designed to play first-person shooters. Still, de Wynter also concluded that OpenAI\u2019s model is smart enough to \u201coperate doors, follow simple objectives, and identify enemies and fire weapons at them\u201d using only simple depictions of a video game world. \u201cSo, while this is a very interesting exploration around planning and reasoning, and could have applications in automated videogame testing, it is quite obvious that this model is not aware of what it is doing,\u201d he added. \u201cI strongly urge everyone to think about what deployment of these models implies for society and their potential misuse.\u201d"

But it was all smiles in a session on Monday featuring Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Austin Mayor Kirk Watson. \"Austin and Uber have a complicated history together,\u201d the mayor said politely. \u201cWith all that said, we're now in a different place.\u201d Khosrowshahi suggested he would not have reacted to Austin\u2019s moves the way Uber\u2019s former CEO Travis Kalanick did back then. Uber, with Lyft, only returned to Austin after the state overrode the city\u2019s regulations in 2017. \u201cWe could have done a lot better,\u201d he said. \u201cIn hindsight, it got to a point it never should have.\u201d Much of the conversation between the CEO and the mayor involved vehicles with two wheels, not four\u2014the Lime e-scooters that are all over town and bookable via the Uber app thanks to the 2018 deal that led Uber to invest in Lime. \"Scooters are obviously kind of a mixed bag in most communities,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThey also create some challenges.\u201d Khosrowshahi emphasized that Uber doesn\u2019t operate those but endorsed micromobility as part of a transportation vision involving fewer cars. \u201cIf you have a ride that's two or three miles or shorter, it doesn't make sense to have a two-ton car pull up,\u201d he said. Especially when an e-scooter or e-bike covers the first or last mile of a trip with transit in between: \u201cMicromobility can be kind of that spoke for mass transit.\u201d The mayor seconded that thought, saying \u201cWe want every tool in the toolbox when it comes to transportation, and particularly sustainable transportation.\u201d For Watson, that vision includes light rail; the city\u2019s Project Connect would add two lines to today\u2019s single route. But advocates have some sales work to do: \u201cUnfortunately, in Texas the word rail is a four-letter word, and we have to fight that.\u201d In some cities, as Khosrowshahi pointed out onstage, Uber\u2019s app lets you see how transit could handle a trip instead of the company\u2019s own services. Neither speaker noted that Austin isn\u2019t one of them, although Khosrowshahi suggested later that the company needed to fix that. \u201cOur competition is car ownership,\u201d he said. \u201cEssentially, our goal is to wire up every single transportation mechanism in a city.\u201d Khosrowshahi put Uber\u2019s contribution to sustainable transportation in terms of its progress electrifying its fleet, saying Uber drivers are switching to EVs seven times faster than average and that 9% of Uber cars in Austin are now EVs. Uber has put some $800 million into boosting that adoption with discounts for drivers\u2014\u201dwe've got deals with Tesla directly where you get $2,000 off\u201d\u2014as well as more subtle ongoing incentives. \"We reduce our take rate per ride if they are driving an EV,\u201d he said. \u201cRiders on average, tip drivers who are driving an EV more.\u201d But Khosrowshahi said Uber\u2019s customer surveys show those same riders aren\u2019t willing to pay an upfront premium for a greener ride\u2014the behavior highlighted by the company\u2019s new emissions-saving tracker. They\u2019re only willing to wait longer for a hybrid or EV: \u201cTheir version is, I'm willing to pay a premium with my time.\u201d Khosrowshahi said later that Uber has to cut costs for its passengers further.\u00a0\"Uber has to be more affordable to consumers,\u201d he said, calling e-scooters one way to make that happen and larger vehicles that could carry 14 or more passengers\u2014\u201dcall it an Uber bus system\u201d\u2014would be another. The company has already experimented with that idea in the US. But both the CEO and the mayor seemed cool on the once-hot potential of autonomous vehicles to transform transportation.\u00a0\u201cI see a lot of promise in those vehicles, but we're not there yet,\u201d Watson said. He advised AV-startup executives to show some humility: \u201cThey need to not start here by saying \u2018I'm here to show you how to do this.'\" Uber ended its own self-driving-car efforts after one killed a pedestrian in Arizona in 2019 but more recently inked a partnership with Waymo to offer rides in its autonomous vehicles in Phoenix. That Alphabet subsidiary exited Austin in 2019 but resumed tests around the city last week. Khosrowshahi suggested that Uber already provides a safer solution. \u201dUber drivers, because they're professional drivers, are safer than non-professional drivers,\" but he backed regulation to set a safety standard for autonomous vehicles. The session wrapped up with the CEO touting Uber\u2019s ambitions to move things beyond people\u2014and not just food but also store purchases. \"We essentially want to build out a local logistics-on-demand infrastructure,\u201d he said, that would let local merchants \u201cout-Amazon Amazon.\u201d"

    "content": "Samsung's new Galaxy A series phones\u2014the A55 5G and the A35 5G\u2014share the familiar rounded rectangle design we've come to expect from Samsung devices, with a front-facing camera embedded in the display and a trio of rear cameras. They're also the first in the A series to get Samsung Knox Vault, a security feature that protects from hardware and software attacks. The Galaxy A55 is the successor to the A54 5G and there are some upgrades. First up is a larger display; the A55 features a 6.6-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 0.2 inches larger than the A54. The base model now comes with 8GB of RAM (up from 6GB) and 128GB of internal storage. There is also an 8GB/256GB variant and the top-of-the-line model comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of space. Some things stay the same, such as the camera setup with a 50MP main shooter with optical image stabilization (OIS), a 12MP ultra-wide camera, and a 5MP macro on the rear. The 32MP front-facing camera is also the same as the A54. Samsung claims the A55 can take great low-light photos thanks to its AI Image Signal Processing. For the A35, the successor to the Galaxy A34 5G, Samsung changed up the main rear camera. The A34 has a 48MP main shooter, an 8MP ultra-wide, and a 5MP macro lens. The A35 comes with a 50MP main camera with OIS along with the same ultra-wide and macro cameras. The starting model comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which is a nice boost from the base A34's 4GB of RAM. The A35 also comes in two other variants, an 8GB/128GB model and an 8GB/256GB version. The display seems to be the same as before; there's a 6.6-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, but the 13MP front-facing camera is no longer housed within the bezel, it's surrounded by pixels. This makes the A35 look a lot like the A55 and the Galaxy S24. Pricing was not announced, but we expect it to be similar to the A54 and A34, which cost around $500 and $250, respectively. Samsung has not specified which regions will get the device, or when they'll launch, but we'll be on the look out for you."

    "content": "UPDATE: Govee says the Neon Rope Light 2 is available now for $69.99 (3m) or $99.99 (5m). Original Story 1/8/24:Govee is at CES to take the wraps off its latest smart lighting products, which include the AI Sync Box Kit 2, Neon Rope Light 2, new AI lighting controls, and a partnership with Corsair. The original Govee Sync Box Kit 2 served as a large departure for Govee. The company previously released TV ambient lights with a camera you'd point at your television. The camera would stare at the screen, then pass along a signal to the lights to \"extend\" colors for a more immersive effect. But the camera system stood out and wasn't always accurate. The AI Sync Box helped solve that problem by reading the video signal directly from an HDMI cord, delivering more accurate colors. And thanks to built-in AI, Govee even produced extra visual effects in specific games. But the original sync box didn't support HDMI 2.1, which inhibited its appeal to gamers. With the Sync Box between your TV and gaming system, you'd lose access to 4K 120Hz gameplay. That's where the AI Sync Box Kit 2 improves on the original. The new Sync Box supports HDMI 2.1, which gets you up to 8K resolution. However, if you want a 120Hz refresh rate, you'll have to step down to 4K resolution. For most gamers, that should be more than enough. Govee also says it improved on the AI to get even more accurate colors, though the company didn't specify if the extra effects now work in more games. You'll still get the sync box, an LED strip, and two light bars in the kit. Govee also announced the Neon Rope Light 2. The updated rope light is more bendable and positionable than the last model and comes with new bend clips to allow new shapes that weren't possible before. Govee showed off a rope light bent in the image of a dolphin. The Govee app will get an update that lets you program the rope light with your camera to recognize the shape and provide better lighting options that make full use of the rope light. The Neon Rope Light 2 will work with Alexa and Google Assistant, and later this year, will get a Matter update as well. The company also announced a collaboration with Corsair that will integrate products from the two companies. Soon, you'll be able to synchronize Corsair RGB peripherals with Govee smart lights and bulbs. You might show PC temperature on your Neon Rope Light 2, for instance, or notifications from games. But that feature will roll out later in Q1. Govee didn't announce pricing for the new AI Sync Box 2 or the Neon Rope Light 2, but they'll be available sometime in the first half of 2024."

    "title": "Superchargers Open Up to Non-Teslas, But Good Luck Finding a Station in Big Cities",
    "author": "Emily Dreibelbis",
    "author_link": "https://www.pcmag.com/authors/emily-dreibelbis",
    "date": "March 13, 2024",
    "content": "While all EV brands will technically have access to the Tesla Supercharger network by the end of 2024, many stations are not accessible to non-Teslas, limiting the impact of a move heralded as a game changer for EV drivers and the industry at large. The restrictions appear particularly strict within cities, where Tesla has barred other brands from using all or most Superchargers. Tesla has not said why it's not opening certain stations, which it does via a software update. (It has promised access at 15,000 Supercharger stations to start.) It could be to prevent overcrowding, particularly in these dense areas. Another issue is that not all Supercharger cords are long enough to reach the port on other brands' vehicles. However, when PCMag tried to power up a Ford Mustang Mach-E at an ineligible Supercharger, the cord reached the car and plugged in via the adapter; it just couldn't charge. In fairness, both Tesla and the brands it's partnered with have stated that only \"upgraded stations,\" not the entire network, will be made available to non-Tesla EVs. And for now, Ford is the only non-Tesla brand with access, with GM, Rivian, Volvo, and Polestar to follow in the spring. But the data below suggests many urban drivers won't see any immediate day-to-day change from Tesla \"opening\" its network, and should be aware of these limits if considering purchasing an EV. According to Tesla's Supercharger map, Chicago has seven stations within city limits. None are available after adjusting the filters for non-Teslas. That means residents might need to drive 30 minutes to an hour if they want to charge with Tesla, undermining any potential convenience. (Note: City limits are not drawn on the Tesla website, so PCMag counted city stations by cross-referencing with Google Maps.) Outside city limits, the number of available Superchargers grows, which helps on weekend trips. For example, highway routes to nearby Chicago destinations such as Minneapolis and Detroit are dotted with eligible stations. In San Francisco, none of the four downtown Superchargers are available to non-Teslas. Same goes for Seattle's four stations, Miami's seven, and 11 of the 12 in New York City. In Los Angeles, a city with high EV registrations per capita, residents have more options, but about half of the Superchargers are still closed to non-Teslas. (Note: With LA's complex city borders, plus areas like Santa Monica and Culver City technically being their own cities, it's hard to get an exact count, though the visual shows a clear reduction.) Ironically, cities are where EVs work best, as they have higher fuel economy there than on highways (the opposite of gas-powered cars). But less than 5% of apartments and other multi-unit dwellings have EV chargers installed, according to Governing. This past winter, some Chicagoans were left stranded when waiting in line at Tesla Superchargers in cold weather. Public charging stations can make or break an urbanite's ability to purchase an EV, though it appears Tesla will not be able to fully solve that problem for the industry. Charging at home is the most convenient way to power up, which is why 80-90% of EV drivers do just that. But installing them is costly and time-consuming, which could result in landlords passing on the cost to residents. Chicago passed a bill in September requiring newly built apartment complexes to have the \"infrastructure to facilitate the future installation of EV charging equipment,\" which is a great start but could take decades to have an impact. For now, drivers can find eligible stations on the dash screen or in mobile apps like FordPass. But even at eligible stations, Tesla has said it will charge non-Teslas a higher rate for the electricity unless the driver subscribes to a $12.99-per-month Supercharging membership. Despite these initial limits, all automakers have agreed to adopt the Tesla-backed NACS port. Starting in 2025, they will abandon the CCS port and manufacture vehicles with NACS, removing the need for an adapter. The move to NACS creates a much-needed industry standard, but it doesn't mean Superchargers become the only option for drivers. Many other public charging networks\u2014from Blink to EVGo\u2014support NACS. But those who cannot charge at home, in cities or otherwise, should be aware it may not fully solve their EV-charging problems, at least for the time being."

    "date": "March 12, 2024",
    "content": "Slow charging remains one of the biggest barriers to EV adoption, but Volvo says its future electric vehicles will charge 15% to 30% faster with the help of a new \"adaptive charging\" battery management system. That means a vehicle that takes 30 minutes to charge today could power up in just 21, without any changes to the content of the battery itself\u2014just the software that surrounds it. Though still an early-stage product not yet on the market, the inventor, Breathe Technologies, says it has undergone \"extensive validation.\" Volvo announced an investment in the London-based startup today through its venture capital arm, Volvo Cars Tech Fund. The patented technology dynamically adjusts the charging rate, whereas traditional battery management systems follow a \"stepped charging pattern\" that use \"pre-determined rules,\" Volvo says. The result is speedier charging with less degradation to the battery. Specifically, it reduces the risk of a phenomenon known as lithium plating, which occurs when lithium deposits build up on the surface of the anode inside the battery, impeding charging. \"The charging time improvements will last across the full battery life cycle without impacting its health status,\" Volvo says. Volvo did not mention which future EVs will have the new software, only saying it will be used in its next-generation vehicles and is compatible with the hardware Volvo has developed for them. That likely does not include Volvo's existing vehicles or the EX30 and EX90, both set to launch later this year, though perhaps future model years could be updated to include the technology. Volvo also touted the environmental benefits of its new investment, noting it could help avoid costly, resource-intensive battery pack replacements. Volkswagen has similarly invested in California-based startup QuantumScape, which also claims to have developed a battery that can last 300,000 miles without degradation. And China's CATL has touted its new batteries, which it says can get 250 miles of charge in just 10 minutes. \"There's a saying in the battery industry: 'There are liars, damn liars, and battery suppliers,'\" Keith Norman, chief sustainability officer at Lyten, a lithium-sulfur battery startup, tells PCMag. So-called breakthrough battery technologies are a dime a dozen these days, but consumers will have to wait at least five to 10 years to try them."

    "author_link": "https://www.pcmag.com/authors/michael-kan",
    "date": "March 13, 2024",
    "content": "A year after introducing it, Microsoft is ready to launch Copilot for Security, a GPT-4-powered program designed to help cybersecurity workers investigate and stop hacks. Copilot for Security will be available for all customers globally on April 1, with support for seven additional languages, along with English. This comes as the company spent the last months previewing the technology with hundreds of companies during an early access period. Copilot for Security is a standalone product featuring plugin support so it can receive data from third-party cybersecurity products. The program can also connect to Microsoft\u2019s existing cloud security offerings, including Microsoft Defender 365, giving customers another tool to help protect their IT networks. According to Microsoft, the goal for Copilot for Security isn\u2019t to replace human workers or existing security products. Rather, the ChatGPT-like program is designed to act as an assistant that can harness existing cybersecurity tools and help professionals respond to and investigate potential hacking incidents.\u00a0The technology takes the cybersecurity intel a company receives from its network to summarize incident reports, and point out potential threats and the corresponding actions that an IT administrator should take to address the danger. In a demo, Microsoft showed the program explaining how a flagged IP address or computer script detected in a network has been tied to select cybercriminal groups. Copilot for Security can also reverse-engineer malware and write reports for a non-technical audience about a security incident, making it easy to share the intelligence across a company. The technology promises to give cybersecurity defenders a potent tool to beat back cybercrime, which continues to surge, says Microsoft CVP for Security Vasu Jakkal. \u201cThe feedback we got from our early access program has been incredible,\u201d she said during a Tuesday press briefing. \"The data we have from early career professionals show us it\u2019s making them faster, more productive,\u201d said Jakkal, who noted they performed 26% faster with their accuracy going up by 35%.\u00a0More experienced cybersecurity professionals also reported working about 22% faster while receiving a 7% productivity bump. But according to Jakkal, the most important feedback shows that 97% of the people who tried Copilot for Security wanted to use it again. PCMag also spoke with Rui Correia, a security operations manager at Signode who\u2019s been using the product. He found that Copilot for Security is adept at streamlining the work his team does, which includes monitoring security threats and responding to them. The product can quickly churn out reports and summarize the threats in easy-to-understand language, saving his team time. \u201cIf we want to understand what malware is doing, or what obfuscated commands an attacker is trying to run, we can put them in Copilot, and it tells us, \u2018Hey this is what this does. This is what the malware is trying to do,\u2019\u201d he said, allowing the customer to ditch running their own sandbox to investigate the malware. \u201cIn terms of the actual quality of the analysis, I haven\u2019t had any issues with it myself, de-coding commands, de-coding malware,\u201d Correia added. \u201cIt\u2019s like talking to another person instead of having to read all the technical details, and it lowers the entry barrier for doing malware analysis as well.\" Still, OpenAI\u2019s GPT technology can sometimes produce the wrong information, so the program includes disclaimers under each answer, telling users to verify its findings. Users can also flag the answers to Microsoft for review.\u00a0In addition, Copilot for Security will explain why it's flagged a piece of activity as malicious, citing sources. Microsoft plans on selling Copilot for Security through a \u201cpay as you go\u201d licensing model. The company is still finalizing that model, but says: \u201cwith this flexible, consumption-based pricing model, you can get started quickly, then scale your usage and costs according to your needs and budget.\u201d"

    "content": "The Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses are getting a little bit smarter with the help of AI. A new feature introduced this week lets you get information on nearby landmarks. It's an extension of existing AI capabilities that let users ask questions about the world around them. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth posted some examples of the new feature in a Threads post. Essentially, a user can look at a landmark and ask the glasses to tell them more about it. The glasses take a picture and then provide details. In the above example, you can see that the Golden Gate Bridge has its \"striking orange color\" so that it's easier to see in the fog. Bosworth also said that the smart glasses will let you share your latest Meta AI interactions in WhatsApp, Messenger, and through a text message. Podcast listeners will also be able to tune Meta AI's readout speeds for better usability in a future update. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also posted some videos on Instagram that showed off the feature during a trip to Montana. In his example, the glasses use audio through the built-in speakers to tell Zuckerberg about the Roosevelt Arch. This is in line with how the feature works when using it for things other than landmarks, where you can get audio through the glasses and a written version in the Meta App. Zuckerberg also asks the glasses \"how many onesies is too many\" and to describe \"how snow is made like a caveman.\" Meta AI willingly answered Mark's inquiries. As Engadget reports, Meta previewed this feature last year as part of Meta AI's multimodal capabilities, which allow people wearing the glasses to better interact with their environment. Part of that is the glasses having access to real-time info powered by Bing Search. For now, the feature is limited to users who have signed up for Meta's early access program. Folks who sign up don't get instant access, though, and will have to wait to be let in. Bosworth didn't say when the feature would officially roll out for everyone."

    "content": "Lenovo has quietly developed a six-legged robot called the Daystar Bot GS set to launch sometime this year that promises \"comprehensive data collection.\" The new robot appears to be Lenovo's latest iteration of its Daystar bot announced in 2020. While the new GS version hasn't been announced anywhere on Lenovo's website or social media accounts, the robot won a 2024 IF design award, whose website offers a few details. \"Step into the forefront of industrial automation and public services,\" the robot's description reads. \"The groundbreaking six-legged design guarantees unmatched stability and maneuverability that surpasses traditional robotic platforms, allowing it to traverse diverse terrains with ease.\" Gone are the days of Daystar bots with wheels. Now, they have six legs, like something ripped from a Black Mirror episode. \"Boasting an advanced control system, cutting-edge perception algorithms, and IP66 robust protection, GS outperforms in unforeseen scenarios, enabling comprehensive data collection at any location and time,\" the Daystar Bot GS's summary continues. The robot appears to have numerous cameras on board. The front has at least three cameras on the \"face\" of the robot. The top and sides of the bot seem to offer some additional tech as well. Compared to Boston Dynamics' Spot robot, which the NYPD previously used for pricey police missions, Lenovo's Daystar Bot GS has more legs and a wider \"face.\" Full specifications for the Daystar GS have not yet been released, however. Lenovo's latest Daystar bot isn't exactly intended for fun around the house like a pet robo-dog. The IF Design Awards' website states that the bot is designed for business, public sector, and government use in the Asian market. So just in case Lenovo's clear laptop didn't make you feel like you were living in a sci-fi movie, its six-legged robot might just do the trick."

    "date": "March 13, 2024",
    "content": "The threat of a TikTok ban in the US became more real on Wednesday when the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to pass a bill that would bar the social media app unless it's sold to a US-friendly entity. The House voted 352 to 65 on the legislation, which would require Beijing-based ByteDance to divest itself from TikTok within 180 days or face a nationwide ban of the social media platform. The bill now moves on to the Senate, where at least a few lawmakers have pledged to support it. In a joint statement, Sens. Mark Warner (D-Virginia) and Marco Rubio (R-Florida) said: \u201cWe were encouraged by today\u2019s strong bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives, and look forward to working together to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law.\u201d President Biden has said he\u2019ll sign the bill if both houses of Congress pass it. So the Senate vote may determine the fate of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which was introduced earlier this month. It could face pushback from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who tells The Washington Post he may block the bill like he did for similar legislation last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think Congress should be trying to take away the First Amendment rights of [170] million Americans,\" he says. Many lawmakers have been rallying behind the bill over concerns that the Chinese government could secretly exploit TikTok to steal data from users and spread propaganda to the American public. ByteDance has fiercely denied it would ever do so. Nevertheless, the company has been using the TikTok app\u00a0to urge potentially millions of users in the US to fight the legislation \u2014 a tactic that may have backfired in Congress. \u201cOver the past week, we saw in real-time how the CCP (Chinese Community Party)-controlled TikTok used its influence and power to force users to contact their representatives if they even wanted to continue using the app,\u201d alleged Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.). \u201cThis is just a small taste of how the CCP weaponizes applications.\u201d The lawmakers also contend that the bill isn\u2019t necessarily a ban, but a way for TikTok to fall under US control. Still, TikTok argues that the legislation threatens to violate free speech rights while imperiling people\u2019s ability to access the app.\u00a0It's unclear if ByteDance would divest. \u201cThis process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: it's a ban,\u201d TikTok said in regards to the House vote.\u00a0\u201cWe are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service.\u201d"

    "content": "Two SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets launched early Monday morning, sending 46 Starlink satellites into space and adding to the thousands already circling Earth. SpaceX confirmed the launch around 1:45 a.m. ET Monday. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also posted about the launch, writing that the new satellites would add 4 Terabits per second of data capacity to its network. The two launches took place in California and Florida, respectively. Nearly 6,000 Starlink satellites are now in Earth's orbit, according to astronomer Jonathan McDowell, who tracks Starlink launches and documents the satellites on his website. Last month, SpaceX said it would remove 100 Starlink satellites from orbit due to a possible design flaw. Last week, Starlink reported that it's reduced network latency by over 30% for US users. SpaceX also wrote a letter to the FCC, dubbing Starlink a \"massive success\" and noting that it's been able to get its cellular system to work on iPhones, Google Pixel, and Samsung Galaxy devices. Starlink offers four different service plans at time of writing. Its standard plan promises download speeds of 25-100Mbps and 5-10Mbps upload speeds, while its priority plan offers 40-220Mbps download speeds and 8-25Mbps upload speeds, according to the provider's website. Starlink's services are available in many countries globally, such as the US, Canada, Australia, nearly all of Europe, Japan, Mongolia, Nigeria, Kenya, and New Zealand, to name a few. According to Starlink's website, a number of African countries like Tunisia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Senegal, and Uganda will gain access to its services this year."

    "content": "Thirty-five US corporations\u2014including Tesla, Netflix, and Ford\u2014paid less in federal income tax than they pay their top five executives, according to new report from the nonprofit Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and the Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF). This is according to data collected between 2018 and 2022 from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which the IPS and ATF examined. The Guardian first reported the groups' findings Wednesday. Despite all of the companies being profitable during that time, very few actually paid federal taxes. Many, like Tesla, actually got tax refunds instead. Data from the IPS and ATF shows that Tesla has continued to dodge any federal tax obligations despite becoming profitable years ago, and actually pulls in millions from government subsidies and loans. One tracker from a corporate and government accountability nonprofit finds that Tesla has taken nearly $2.9 billion across 109 government subsidies since its inception. While Musk sought a multibillion-dollar pay package later denied by a Delaware judge, the median Tesla worker made just $34,000 in 2022, according to the report. In the past five years, Tesla has paid its top executives a staggering $2.5 billion, made $4.4 billion in profits, and paid $0 in federal income taxes. It actually got a $1 million federal tax refund. T-Mobile and Netflix are also on the IPS and ATF's \"Terrible Ten\" companies report. T-Mobile reportedly raked in $80 million in federal income tax refunds, meaning instead of paying federal taxes, it got a multimillion payout. Netflix gave its top executives $652 million in compensation in the past five years and made over $15 billion in profit while paying a tax rate of just 1.6%, or $236 million, according to the report. Similarly, Ford paid a tax rate of 1.5%, about $120 million, during that same period. For reference, the average American pays a tax rate of 24.8%, according to data from the OECD trade organization. Netflix qualified its data to The Guardian, claiming that it paid over $2 billion in taxes globally from 2018 until 2022. It added that it is complying with US tax laws. \"In 2023 we paid nearly $1.2 billion in global income taxes, the majority of which was US federal income tax,\" a Netflix representative told PCMag via email. PCMag has reached out to T-Mobile and Tesla for comment. American International Group, Nextera Energy, Darden Restaurants, Metlife, Duke Energy, and FirstEnergy, also made the IPS and ATF's \"Terrible Ten\" list due to paying little to no taxes while compensating executives with hundreds of millions. The report acknowledges that the companies are indeed following US tax guidelines, which they describe as \"legal tax dodging.\" A 2017 US tax cut \"made the problem of undertaxed corporations worse,\" it says, by cutting the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The report urges Congress to hike the corporate tax rate and close loopholes. \"Raising the corporate tax rate to 28% (just half way back to Obama-era levels) would generate $1.3 trillion in new revenue over the next decade,\" it says. \"Corporate tax dodging deprives us of billions of dollars in corporate revenue that could be used to lower costs and improve services for ordinary people,\" the report's authors argue. \"Exorbitant executive pay wastes money that could be spent on expanding operations and raising the wages of everyday workers. It also contributes to the nation\u2019s yawning income and wealth gaps, which destabilize our economy, disrupt our society and endanger our democracy.\" Editor's Note: This story has been updated to include additional comment from Netflix."

    "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration has cleared SpaceX to conduct a third Starship test flight, which could happen as soon as tomorrow. \u201cThe FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy and financial responsibility requirements,\u201d the agency said in a statement on Wednesday. As a result, the regulator has issued a license that permits SpaceX to conduct the launch from Boca Chica, Texas. The same license also allows the company to stage water landings of the Super Heavy Booster in the Gulf of Mexico and of the Starship vehicle in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX had already been preparing for the FAA license\u2019s approval by stacking a third Starship vehicle for launch. The company is now aiming to conduct the third flight test starting at 8 a.m. EST on Thursday, during a 110-minute test window. The launch will be live streamed, although it could be cancelled if the weather is bad. During previous two test flights, the Starship vehicle successfully took off from the launch pad only to later explode \u2014 all the while sending back data to the company. SpaceX says it's since corrected the errors while planning for a more ambitious third flight that\u2019ll test even more Starship systems. SpaceX is looking to pull off a \u201csuccessful ascent burn of both stages, opening and closing Starship\u2019s payload door, a propellant transfer demonstration during the upper stage\u2019s coast phase, the first ever re-light of a Raptor engine while in space, and a controlled reentry of Starship.\" The third flight promises to bring SpaceX a step closer to using the Starship vehicle for human-led missions to the Moon and Mars. The company also plans on using Starship to accelerate deployment of next-generation Starlink satellites."

    "date": "March 14, 2024",
    "content": "Amazon product pages can now be made with a generative AI tool that pulls information from a URL, the e-commerce giant announced Wednesday. The new feature designed for sellers means that customers will likely see more and more product listings that have been fully created by AI when shopping on the site. Amazon says the new URL-based feature is designed to save sellers time by automating more of the listing creation process, and is expected to fully roll out to US sellers \"in the coming weeks.\" The new feature was created for sellers who already have their own standalone websites and want to be able to increase their overall reach by also selling the same products on Amazon. But there is a chance this duplicating feature could be used to quickly create counterfeit copy listings of others' legitimate products. Generative AI tools may mean faster and more listings, but it could also make fake sellers' lives easier, too. While Amazon forbids the sale of counterfeit products, users have complained online that it's been a big problem for years. Amazon launched its Counterfeit Crimes Unit in 2020 in an effort to address the issue (and just last month, Amazon and BMW won a suit against a seller who offered fake BMW parts). Considering this, the new URL tool bears a lengthy warning that tells sellers they must be the legal owner of the website's content in order to use the corresponding link. \"Failure to accurately represent your authority to use this content could result in action taken against your seller account and/or could subject you to legal ramifications,\" the disclaimer reads. Amazon already uses generative AI in a variety of other ways, with an existing tool that can generate products' description sections and new backgrounds for product ads. Amazon also rolled out AI-powered review highlights in a \"Customers Say\" section last year that summarizes frequently mentioned tidbits from reviews. Sometimes these can be informative, and sometimes they can be downright funny. Amazon says it's continuing to develop AI-powered features across its business. The tech giant offers Anthropic's new Claude 3 Sonnet and Haiku generative AI models through its Amazon Bedrock service for businesses, and says in its URL feature announcement that it's now \"even more optimistic\" about the future of its generative AI tools."

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump has made railing against electric vehicles a central part of his platform, going as far as telling EV supporters to \"rot in hell\" in a Christmas Day social media post. Yet Trump this week told CNBC host Joe Kernen that \"I'm all for electric cars, but you have to have all of the alternatives also.\" Trump did not elaborate on what alternatives he supports, and Kernen didn't ask. But in December (before the \"rot in hell\" post), he told Fox News host Sean Hannity that \"we should sell electric, but we should also sell a combustion engine gasoline cars. We can sell hybrids. The hybrids are fine. We should be able to buy everything. Some people might like an electric car. We should be able to buy an electric car.\" On CNBC, Trump quickly pivoted to familiar EV criticisms. EVs \"don't go far, they cost too much, and they're all going to be made in China,\" Trump said. A push for an all-EV future, meanwhile, was crafted \"by very, very stupid people.\" He also cast doubt that the nation's electric grid can handle a shift to EVs, though an MIT study found that charging during off-peak times may make it feasible. And he denounced Biden's decision to cancel oil and gas drilling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska, which the Trump administration approved in 2020 and looks poised to revive should Trump win in 2024. Trump's comments come shortly after he met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk at Mar-a-Lago; \"We obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,\" Trump said on CNBC. Musk has also clashed with the Biden administration for \"ignoring\" Tesla, though Biden has made the shift to EVs a major part of his presidency. He approved an electric vehicle tax credit that's valid until 2032. And his funding efforts are boosting domestic battery production and research in an attempt to counter China's dominance in this area, helping create a national charging network, and swapping diesel school buses for electric. Still, EV demand has declined, and hybrids are proving popular for automakers like Toyota, Ford. The Biden administration is also expected to soften its EV adoption goals, as requested by the car makers and the United Auto Workers, Reuters reports. The United Autoworkers union officially endorsed President Biden for reelection in January, though Trump said in the CNBC interview that \"the auto workers are going to vote\" for him."

    "content": "Engineers at freshly launched AI startup Cognition Labs have released Devin, an AI tool that can autonomously code, complete engineering jobs on Upwork, and even tune its own AI models. Devin takes the premise of GitHub and Microsoft's Copilot developer tool one step further, as it's able to finish whole projects on its own without human intervention. In one video, Cognition Labs CEO Scott Wu shows how Devin users are able to view the AI tool's command line, code editor, and workflow as it moves through various steps to complete coding projects and data research tasks. Once Devin receives a request, it's able to scour the internet for educational materials to learn how to complete tasks and can debug its own issues encountered during the engineering process. Users are able to intervene if desired, however. \"Teaching AI to be a programmer is actually a very deep algorithmic problem that requires the system to make complex decisions and look a few steps into the future to decide what route it should pick,\" Wu tells Bloomberg. \"It\u2019s almost like this game that we\u2019ve all been playing in our minds for years, and now there\u2019s this chance to code it into an AI system,\" Wu adds. In Bloomberg's tests, Devin was able to code a basic Pong game and create a website from scratch in under 20 minutes. Non-technical folks could use Devin to develop their own projects, and more time-consuming, cumbersome tasks could be offloaded to the AI for it to solve. It's a bit ironic, though, that software engineers are releasing an AI tool that's designed to essentially replace software engineers. \"It\u2019s less like an assistant helping with code and more like a real worker doing its own thing,\" computer scientist Silas Alberti tells Bloomberg based on his experience using Devin. The internet jab \"learn to code,\" previously posted in Twitter reply sections under news of media industry layoffs, has now become even less relevant in the AI era. There's certainly a chance Devin may be used to outsource work or load engineers with more tasks to be completed overall, essentially removing some lower-level engineering jobs from the market."

    "content": "OpenAI will launch its text-to-video generator Sora later this year, but the rollout will be slow amid concerns that the technology could threaten jobs and spread misinformation. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, OpenAI CTO Mira Murati says it's expensive for Sora to generate realistic video clips, but the company is optimizing the technology to require less computing power for its upcoming release. Currently, Sora can only create clips up to 60 seconds long, without any voice or sound. But Murati says OpenAI plans on adding audio to the Sora technology \"eventually.\" Sora may leave some in Hollywood concerned about their future job prospects given that it can churn out realistic clips that are significantly better than other text-to-video generators. But Murati notes that Sora still makes mistakes, like misunderstanding the user\u2019s prompt or struggling to faithfully render people\u2019s hands or the movement of cars passing by. To address concerns about misuse, OpenAI plans on adding a watermark and metadata to all the video clips that Sora produces, making it easier for the public to identify AI-generated footage. In addition, Sora will be barred from generating images of public figures, tamping down its ability to deepfake politicians and celebrities. Sora may also face legal challenges\u2014a problem OpenAI is already experiencing with ChatGPT.\u00a0The Wall Street Journal asked Sora to generate a video of a mermaid reviewing a smartphone with her crab assistant, for example, and the result made the crab look strikingly similar to a character from SpongeBob SquarePants. According to Murati, OpenAI has been using publicly available videos and licensed data, including content from stock image provider Shutterstock, to train the program to render life-like video. But it's not clear if Sora has been trained on YouTube or Facebook videos, too. Surprisingly, Murati said she didn't know if videos from YouTube, Instagram and Facebook were included in the training data."

    "date": "March 11, 2024",
    "content": "SpaceX can start using additional radio frequencies to bolster data capacity for Starlink, according to a new FCC ruling. On Friday, the US regulator approved a SpaceX proposal to use \u201cE-band\u201d spectrum for the company\u2019s second-generation Starlink network, in addition to the Ka and Ku-band spectrum. The decision allows the company to tap the \u201c71.0-76.0GHz (space-to-Earth) and 81.0-86.0GHz (Earth-to-space) frequency bands\u201d for 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites, which the FCC also cleared back in December 2022. At the time, the FCC deferred on whether it would let SpaceX use E-band spectrum, saying it had \u201cnot yet adopted band-specific service rules for these frequencies.\u201d But on Friday, the US regulator authorized the company to use the additional spectrum, explaining it \u201cwill benefit consumers by expanding the capacity of its Gen2 Starlink system.\u201d SpaceX plans on using the E-band spectrum to bolster communications between the orbiting Starlink satellites and the company\u2019s \u201cgateway\u201d ground stations, which are connected to fiber networks. \u201cUp to 32 satellites can transmit to a single gateway at once, for a maximum number of 64 co-frequency beams transmitting to the same earth station at any one time,\u201d the FCC\u2019s order notes. The agency also found that SpaceX\u2019s use of the E-band spectrum should \u201cpresent no new or increased frequency conflicts with other satellite operations.\u201d Back in February 2023, SpaceX tweeted that it planned on using the radio frequencies for backhaul purposes, which promises to help the second-generation satellites \u201cprovide ~4x more capacity per satellite than earlier iterations.\u201d In the same month, the FCC also granted SpaceX special temporary authority to test the E-band spectrum over second-gen Starlink satellites for up to 60 days. \"SpaceX will use the E-band spectrum to communicate with gateway earth stations located throughout the US and around the world,\" the company's application said at the time. The company also noted that the E-Band access would help Starlink \"meet rapidly growing demand from consumers for high-speed, low-latency broadband service that can exceed existing Ka-band gateway capacity.\" In July, the FCC then granted the company another 60 day extension to test using the E-band spectrum. \"SpaceX has operated these gateway links pursuant to STA (special temporary authority) for months and has received no complaints from any authorized spectrum user,\" the company said. Despite Friday's full approval, the FCC order requires SpaceX to harness the E-band spectrum with various conditions in place. For example, the US regulator notes: \"SpaceX may need to modify its operations in the event that additional FSS operators seek to operate in these frequency bands to the extent necessary to ensure the protection of adjacent band services.\u201d Editor's note: This story has been updated with more details about SpaceX's Starlink system using the E-band spectrum."

First teased last year, this emissions savings tracker is rolling out now and will display the CO2 pollution you avoided by picking Uber's two most efficient categories of cars. To see that estimate, tap the Account shortcut in the Uber app and look for the \u201cEstimated CO2 saved\u201d section. That should add up all of the carbon pollution avoided since 2021 by taking Uber Green, the ride-hailing service\u2019s category for hybrid and electric vehicles, and Uber Comfort Electric, its higher-end option for \u201cspecific premium electric vehicles\u201d such as the Tesla Model 3 and Ford\u2019s Mustang Mach-E. In my copy, this section lists only 338 grams from one EV ride\u2013presumably the Tesla I took to the airport in Las Vegas in January at the end of CES. I remember many more rides in Toyota hybrids on the service, but this estimate doesn\u2019t reflect them. Why? Uber\u2019s methodology page explains that this estimate includes a rider\u2019s direct choices of one of those two more efficient options (I will admit here that I usually cheap out and stick with an UberX request), and the times when the service has matched a rider automatically to a zero-emission vehicle. That page further notes: \u201cEmission savings are calculated as the difference in CO2 emitted from low-emission ride options on the Uber app and those of their standard-emission counterparts.\u201d Uber\u2019s announcement adds that this feature is available for teenage account holders too and says the company will later add estimates for carbon-pollution savings for \u201call-electric autonomous rides, trips with UberX Share, and rides on e-bikes and e-scooters booked in the Uber app.\u201d But for the most efficient way to get around cities\u2014electric-powered transit, an option for which Uber\u2019s app offers trip planning in some cities\u2014you\u2019ll have to check with Google Maps to see the carbon savings from that choice. Uber has been working to transition from fossil fuel-powered vehicles for many years\u2014it was testing EV fleets in some cities back in 2016\u2014with the occasional push from such mandates as a California requirement to have 90% of ride-hail vehicles be electric by 2030. In 2020, the company committed to have a 100% zero-emissions fleet in North America and Europe by 2030, and worldwide by 2040."

    "date": "March 12, 2024",
    "content": "Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is not a fan of a US bill that would ban TikTok if it doesn't sever its ties to China. \"This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!\" Musk wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, which he owns. \"If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite 'foreign control' as the issue, but it does not.\" Musk was responding to assertions from Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) that the TikTok bill is a \"trojan horse\" that gives the president the power to ban websites and targets US companies. \"The President will be given the power to ban WEB SITES, not just Apps,\" Rep. Massie tweeted. \"The person breaking the new law is deemed to be the U.S. (or offshore) INTERNET HOSTING SERVICE or App Store, not the 'foreign adversary.'\" He points to bill text that says: \"The term 'foreign adversary controlled application' means a website, desktop application, mobile application, or augmented or immersive technology application that is operated, directly or indirectly (including through a parent company, subsidiary, or affiliate)\" by ByteDance or TikTok. Though TikTok is primarily a mobile-focused experience, it's also accessible on the web, similar to Facebook, Instagram, and Musk's X. Bill sponsors argue that it's not an act of censorship. \"This legislation does not regulate speech. It is focused entirely on foreign adversary control\u2014not the content of speech being shared,\" a bipartisan group of lawmakers said earlier this month. \"This bill only applies to specifically defined social media apps subject to the control of foreign adversaries, as defined by Congress.\" The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would ban apps controlled by foreign adversaries; here that largely applies to ByteDance-owned properties like TikTok. The bill also \"creates a process for the President to designate certain, specifically defined social media applications\" controlled by \"a foreign adversary\" as a threat to national security. Such apps, including any web versions, would then be banned from app stores and web hosting services, respectively. TikTok could get around a US ban by severing ties with ByteDance, which is really the ultimate goal here. No one really expects TikTok to be fully banned in the US (especially in an election year when both candidates need the votes of younger, TikTok-obsessed voters). But whether that happens remains to be seen. Former President Trump, who came out against this most recent TikTok ban because it would benefit Meta, ironically kicked off the TikTok ban discussion himself with a 2020 executive order that was similar to the pending legislation. There was talk of Microsoft buying TikTok before Oracle stepped in as a technology partner. President Biden then rescinded Trump's EO but left the door open to a more comprehensive solution. The Biden administration has said it will support the bill, which has received plenty of bipartisan support. The bill itself was introduced by Reps. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL). Over 20 other Republican representatives are also named \"co-leaders\" of the measure. Regardless, Republicans are somewhat divided on the bill. While Massie is opposed, Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox said he supports the bill Monday, indirectly refuting TikTok's claims that banning its app poses a First Amendment violation. Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who has publicly criticized TikTok for years, supports the latest bill. Musk, meanwhile, didn't elaborate on his objection beyond that one tweet. But he has been critical of TikTok. In June 2022, he mused: \"Is TikTok destroying civilization? Some people think so.\" Last year, Musk said he tried using TikTok, but \"felt their AI probing my brain, so I stopped.\" Following an advertiser exodus last year, meanwhile, Musk implied that TikTok should be boycotted instead of his own social media platform. The US bill was unanimously approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee last week. The US House of Representatives will vote on it Wednesday morning. TikTok has already seen 39 state-level bans across the US prohibiting it from being used on government devices. Many other countries have also banned TikTok from government devices at the national level, and India has instated a complete ban across the board. Efforts to ban the app overall at the US state level, however, has received pushback from the courts."

    "content": "Motorola has updated two of its more affordable phone offerings. Both the Moto G Power 5G and its less powerful sibling, the Moto G 5G, run on Android 14 and gain new displays, processors, and camera enhancements in their 2024 iterations.\u00a0They support many US 5G bands, include water-repellant designs, and offer fingerprint readers for biometric security. Motorola upgraded the Moto G Power 5G's display from 6.5 inches on the 2024 model to\u00a06.7 inches with 2,400 by 1,080 pixels. The LCD retains its variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz and gains Dolby Atmos support for improved sound quality. The G Power 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7020 processor and comes with 128GB of UFS 2.2 storage with 8GB RAM. The phone carries over the 50MP f/1.8 main camera from the 2023 model, but it now includes optical image stabilization (OIS) for sharper shots. The secondary 8MP camera on the back serves as both an ultra-wide angle shooter with a 118-degree field of view as well as a macro camera for close-ups. A 16MP selfie camera on the front has an aperture of f/2.4. Video capture is limited to a resolution of Full HD at 30fps. Motorola says the G Power 5G's 5,000mAh battery offers up to 30W of fast wired charging, as well as up to 15W of wireless charging. Other specs include Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a USB-C 2.0 port for charging. The Moto G Power 5G comes in either Midnight Blue or Pale Lilac and costs $299.99. You can get it at Cricket Wireless beginning on March 22, though it will be available unlocked via Motorola\u2019s website, as well as at\u00a0Amazon and Best Buy starting on March 29. The Moto G 5G might not be quite as powerful as its sibling but shares some of its features. The phone\u2019s 6.6-inch screen is slightly smaller than the one found on the Moto G Power 5G and it has a lower resolution of 1,612 by 720 pixels, but it has a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, along with its Dolby Atmos support for improved sound. The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor with 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. The phone has the same 5,000mAh battery as the Moto G Power 5G but is limited to 18W of wired fast charging with no wireless option. It sports a 50MP f/1.8 main camera but lacks the OIS found in the G Power 5G. A 2MP macro camera graces the rear while an 8MP selfie camera is located on the front.\u00a0Video capture tops out at 1080p at 30fps. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and an FM radio. The Moto G 5G comes in Sage Green and costs $199.99. It will first be available at T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile on March 21, though you will subsequently be able to grab it unlocked at Amazon, Best Buy, and Motorola\u2019s website beginning on May 2."

    "date": "March 13, 2024",
    "content": "The European Union's Parliament on Wednesday approved the AI Act, which will regulate generative AI and broader AI technology in the region. The vote tally was 523 members in favor, 46 against, and 49 abstained. AI Act co-lead Brando Benifei, of Italy, tweeted that the act, which took two years to pass, is designed to put humans before AI. \"Thanks to Parliament, unacceptable AI practices will be banned in Europe and the rights of workers and citizens will be protected,\" according to Benifei, who added that a European Artificial Intelligence Office will be set up to help companies comply with the rules before they come into force. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded to the news with a note that the AI Act will help Europe's workforce and \"set a blueprint for trustworthy AI throughout the world.\" The AI Act's passage means that once the law is finalized and put into effect, AI systems will be categorized into one of four risk categories and be regulated accordingly. Any AI tools deemed \"unacceptable\" would be subject to an outright ban, such as biometric categorization, social scoring, emotion recognition, and predictive policing tools powered by AI. Any AI tools being used for transportation, critical infrastructure, education, safety, employment, law enforcement, immigration, or court records purposes, for example, would be deemed \"high-risk\" and regulated (but not necessarily banned) under the law. Only AI applications deemed \"minimal risk\" or \"no risk,\" such as AI-powered video games, would escape EU oversight, High-risk applications won't be allowed to go public in the EU until they have provided adequate documentation to ensure they're safe and use \"high quality\" data, the commission says. When people encounter AI tools like chatbots online, the law will require companies to disclose to EU users that they're interacting with an AI, not a real person. \"Humans should be made aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back,\" the commission says. The European Parliament also notes that general-purpose AI systems (GPAI) will have to comply with EU copyright laws and publish \"detailed summaries of the content used for training.\" Copyright holders are allowed to protect their work from text or data mining, meaning that as long as their work has been opted out from such uses, generative AI developers will require permission from the copyright holders to use their work. Once it becomes law, the EU's AI Act will likely have massive implications for generative AI models trained on vast quantities of often copyrighted web content. It's currently unclear how AI firms will respond to the law. AI companies could choose to adapt and make their tools comply with the Act's provisions, start a new legal battle, or leave the EU entirely. It could take up to three years for the AI Act's provisions to be fully implemented. \"Prohibitions will take effect after six months, the governance rules and the obligations for general-purpose AI models become applicable after 12 months and the rules for AI systems...will apply after 36 months,\" the commission says."

    "content": "If you use a Roku account, make sure you secure it: Hackers recently targeted over 15,000 users of the TV streaming platform to buy unauthorized subscriptions. On Friday, Roku notified authorities in California and Maine about the data breach, which ensnared 15,363 US residents. The hackers targeted Roku users from Dec. 28, 2023, to Feb. 21, 2024. According to the company\u2019s data breach notice, the cybercriminals likely hijacked the Roku accounts by using login/password combinations leaked from previous hacks at third-party services. Since some users like to use the same login/password combinations across multiple websites, the leaked credentials gave the hackers a way to break into the affected Roku accounts. \u201cAfter gaining access, they then changed the Roku login information for the affected individual Roku accounts, and, in a limited number of cases, attempted to purchase streaming subscriptions,\u201d the company said. BleepingComputer adds that the hackers were likely taking over the Roku accounts with the goal of selling access to them for as little as $0.50. In return, buyers could make fraudulent purchases with the accounts, including Roku streaming devices and peripherals. Roku discovered the hijacking in January. In response, the company identified the affected accounts, reset their passwords, and canceled the purchased streaming subscriptions, if any were made. The company also issued refunds for unwanted purchases. \u201cFinally, our team continues to actively monitor for signs of suspicious activity, to ensure that all customer information and data is kept secure,\u201d Roku added. No payment card data, birth dates, or Social Security numbers were exposed during the incident. The company issued the data breach notice over a week after the company began forcing users to opt into its new dispute-resolution terms, which can prevent a consumer from suing the company. To force users to agree, Roku has been displaying a pop-up on its TVs that can effectively disable the device unless the user opts in to the new dispute-resolution terms. However, Roku told PCMag that the new data breach disclosure has nothing to do with the dispute resolution terms. The company's data breach notice is urging affected users to secure their accounts using a unique password. However, it doesn't appear Roku offers any two-factor authentication to make it harder for hackers to breach user accounts."

    "content": "A new demo gives an early look at how OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT tech can power humanoid robots, giving them the ability to have full conversations with humans. The demo comes from the startup Figure, which is developing a general purpose robot that promises to one day replace what it calls \u201cunsafe and undesirable\u201d human jobs. Last month, the startup announced a partnership with OpenAI to use its AI models to expand the machine\u2019s ability to perceive, reason, and interact. On Wednesday, Figure posted a video that demonstrated some of the early results. By tapping OpenAI\u2019s models, the bot is able to speak and interpret its surroundings. In the demo, the robot\u2014dubbed Figure 01\u2014uses the abilities to see that a red apple has been placed in its field of view. The machine then gives the apple to the human user after he asks, \u201cCan I have something to eat?\u201d \u201cSure thing,\u201d Figure 01 replies. What\u2019s interesting about the demo is how the machine can understand general commands from the human user, without needing to know all the specifics. For example, Figure 01 explains it gave the apple to the human user because \u201cit was the only edible item I could provide you with.\u201d The machine is also able to pick up some trash and place it in a nearby bin when the human command is merely \u201cpick up this trash.\u201d In addition, Figure 01 is smart enough to know that an empty dish and cup placed in front of it should eventually be moved to a drying rack nearby. The robot then uses its metal hands to move the dish and cup to the rack. \u201cI think I did pretty well,\u201d Figure 01 says when asked about its performance. \u201cThe apple found its new owner, the trash is gone, and the tableware is right where it belongs.\u201d That said, the robot did need a moment to process each human command. There\u2019s no word on when the robot will officially launch. But Figure is partnering with OpenAI in the hopes it\u2019ll speed up the \u201ccommercial deployment\u201d of its robots."

    "content": "TikTok might be developing its own \"TikTok Photos\" app, according to text and images published by a known Android feature leaker and reverse engineer. The purported app will allow existing TikTok users to get started with TikTok Photos by importing or syncing their publicly posted photos already on TikTok to the new app. By diving into TikTok app version 33.8.4, a leaker known as AssembleDebug claims to have uncovered strings of code that show TikTok users may soon be able to share their posts to TikTok Photos, download the TikTok Photos app, and open that app. The leaker, who typically shares information about potential upcoming features from Google, also published images that may be the TikTok Photos app's logo. It looks like a red \"P,\" with another cyan mark below it. According to the post, TikTok Photos is currently being built for Android and iOS and is slated to launch \"soon.\" TikTok has ventured beyond videos before. In late 2022, TikTok launched a photo carousel feature for mobile users called \"Photo Mode,\" which displays user-selected images in an Instagram Stories-like fashion. If a standalone TikTok Photos app is indeed in the works, it would be well-positioned to compete with Meta's Instagram. TikTok Photos would be ironic, considering Instagram launched its short-form vertical videos feature \"Reels\" after TikTok gained traction in the US. As the two apps compete for user attention, leakers suggested last month that Instagram may launch a Snapchat-like \"Friend Map\" feature that would allow users to see select accounts' locations. Considering TikTok has logged billions of downloads across iOS and Android, it's possible the app could successfully pull users over en masse to TikTok Photos\u2014as long as it doesn't get banned in the US first."
